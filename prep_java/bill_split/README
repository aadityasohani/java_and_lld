Create an expense sharing application.

An expense sharing application is where you can add your expenses and split it among different people.

The app keeps balances between people as in who owes how much to whom.


SOLUTION:

User{
    name,
    map<user, int> amountOwed,
    totalAmountOwed

    addAmountOwed(user, int)
    settleAmount(user, int)

}

Group{
    name,
    User[],
    Expense[] expenses

    addUser()
    addExpense
    addAmountOwed(User lender, User borrower, int amount)
    settleAmount(User lender, User borrower, int amount)

}


Expense{
    reason,
    amount,
    User paidBy,
    User[] dividedBetween

    changeAmount(int newAmount)
    addDividedBetweenUser(User u)
    removeDividedBetweenUser(User u)
}
